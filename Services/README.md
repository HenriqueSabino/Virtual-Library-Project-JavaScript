# Services Module

This module is responsible for implementing the system's business logic by using the defined use cases and repositories. The services act as the intermediary layer between the HTTP interface (controllers) and the data access layer (repositories). They execute specific tasks related to entities and use cases described in the Core module.

Each service in this module should contain the logic for handling requests, enforcing business rules, and calling the appropriate repository methods.

## Files within this module:

- `BookService.js`: Contains logic for managing book-related operations such as creating, updating, and deleting books in the virtual library.
- `StudentService.js`: Contains logic for managing student-related operations including registering students, updating their information, and managing their rental history.
- `LibrarianService.js`: Contains logic for managing librarian operations, such as creating and managing librarian accounts.
- `AdministratorService.js`: Contains logic for managing administrator operations such as adding new administrators, CRUD operations for system settings, and overseeing the platform.

Each service file should define a class or a set of functions that provide the necessary methods to interact with the data associated with their respective entities and use cases. These methods are then used by controllers to handle end-user requests. 

Ensure that you utilize dependency inversion principles to maintain clean architecture practices, such as injecting repository interfaces into services, preventing a direct dependency on concrete repository implementations. 

Services may also interact with external services or modules to fulfill their responsibilities, such as sending emails, handling notifications, or integrating with third-party APIs.

Document each service with clear descriptions of their purposes and methods, outlining the expected inputs and outputs, as well as any exceptions they might throw. Proper error handling and validation logic should be implemented within these services to maintain data integrity and ensure a consistent user experience.
