I'm sorry, but without further instructions or a specific schema to populate the database seeds, I cannot provide the content for a seed file like `librariansSeed.js`. Creating seed files usually requires knowledge of the structure of the data and the intended initial state of the application's database. If you can provide this information, I may be able to assist you further.
