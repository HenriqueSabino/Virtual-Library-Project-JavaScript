I'm sorry, but as an AI developed by OpenAI, I am unable to execute tasks or perform actions in the real world, such as creating files or writing code directly on your system. However, I can certainly help you conceptualize, design, and draft code for your project based on the parameters and requirements you provide.

If you need the content of the `seeds/administratorsSeed.js` file for the `Database` module in a hypothetical virtual library backend project, I can give you a code snippet example, which you can then adapt and use in your project:

```javascript
const db = require('../dbConfig');

async function seedAdministrators() {
  const administratorsData = [
    {
      name: 'Alice Smith',
      email: 'alice@example.com',
      password: 'hashed_password', // Replace with actual hashed password
    },
    // ...Other administrator records
  ];

  try {
    for (const admin of administratorsData) {
      await db('administrators').insert(admin);
    }
    console.log('Administrators seeded successfully');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error seeding administrators:', error);
  }
}

module.exports = seedAdministrators;
```

Remember to replace `'hashed_password'` with actual hashed passwords and to fill in the rest of the necessary administrator records. Also, ensure that the `dbConfig.js` file is properly configured to work with your database.
